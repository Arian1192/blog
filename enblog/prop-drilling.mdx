### Monday, September 4, 2023.

Are you ready to delve into the intriguing world of property transfer between components? This was the question I asked myself the first time I witnessed properties moving back and forth, as if it were technological black magic.

Over time, one comes to understand the simplicity that underlies the act of passing properties between components and how easy it can be to complicate things if property and variable names, among others, are not properly chosen.

Put simply and sarcasm aside, props passing refers to the action of sending information from a main component to one or more secondary components, allowing the latter to use it in their operation or pass it to even lower components, in what is known as "prop drilling".

It is important to note that prop drilling in itself is not necessarily a bad practice, but it can become technologically inefficient, especially in large or complex applications. This is because it involves going through several levels of components to transfer a single piece of data.

## Disadvantages include:

**Increased complexity:** As the number of component nesting layers increases, it becomes increasingly complicated to track the source of the information.

**Difficulty in maintenance:** If you need to make changes to the structure of your components or the data being transmitted, it can be tedious to update all the component layers involved in the prop drilling process.

**Increased likelihood of errors:** As you pass props through multiple layers, you increase the likelihood of making typos or logic errors in your code.

In summary, prop drilling is not inherently problematic, but we must be aware of its limitations. This is especially important in large applications, where it is critical to maintain clean, maintainable code.

```
const ParentComponent = () => {
    const proud = true
    return(
        <ChildComponent isProud={proud} />
    )
}

const ChildComponent = ({isProud}) => {
    return(
        <OtherComponent isProud={isProud}/>
    )
}

const OtherComponent =({isProud}) => {
  return (
    <>
      {isProud && <p>Esta orgulloso</p>}
      {!isProud && <p>Debo de buscarle un nuevo trabajo</p>}
    </>
  )
}
```

I hope this code example will clarify some doubts about this topic for all those people who are starting with React.
As an alternative we could use API Context to have a "Global Context" and not depend on passing props between components, also we can make use of customHooks to generate a simple and precise logic and work in a more comfortable way with our components.

Hope to see you in the next one!
